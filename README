Sphene Community Tools (SCT) - http://sct.sphene.net
Copyright (C) by Herbert Poul (herbert.poul@gmail.com)


Sphene Community Tools are django applications designed to be easily
pluggable into any django project.


## Directories

- libs/		Contains small python libraries which are used by SCT.
- patches/	Django patches which need to be applied.
- sphenecoll/	Collection of django application (the base source for SCT).
- static/	Static media files which contain images and css.

## Requirements

- [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com) - I'm using the latest version from 
  the subversion trunk.
- Python >= 2.4

## Installation

### Apply Patches

See the patches/ directory which contains django patches which are 
needed for SCT. It currently contains the following files:

- permalink_with_additional_function_arg.diff - see <http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/3530>


### Python library path

You need to add libs/ and sphenecoll/ to your python include path and
static/ needs to be served from your django installation.
(static/sphene/ is enough)


## Examples

The examples/ directory (currently) contains one example project.
Please see the README file in it's directory (examples/simpleproject)
for more information.
