Sphene Community Tools are django applications designed to be easily
pluggable into any django project.


## DIRECTORIES

- sphenecoll/	Collection of django application (the base source for SCT).

## Requirements

- [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com) - I'm using the latest version from 
  the subversion trunk.
- Python >= 2.4

## INSTALLATION

### Apply Patches

See the patches/ directory which contains django patches which are 
needed for SCT.

### Python library path

You need to add libs/ and sphenecoll/ to your python include path and
static/ needs to be served from your django installation.
(static/sphene/ is enough)
